# Afame-Technologies-Data-Analysis-Internship-projects
This is the Github repository to store three projects done during my summer internship of 2 months at Afame Technologies as a Data Analyst Intern. These projects are Sales Data Analysis , HR Data Analysis and Titanic Survival Prediction. Thank You!

Project 1: Sales Data Analysis:

I have thoroughly analyzed our sales data using Power BI by following a systematic approach:

1. Defined clear objectives to identify sales trends, understand customer behavior, and optimize pricing strategies.
2. Imported and integrated the data using the "Get Data" feature in Power BI, combining multiple sources through Power Query Editor.
3. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats, and created necessary calculated columns.
4. Defined relationships between tables and created measures and calculated fields using DAX in the data modeling phase.
5. Used Power BI’s visualization tools for exploratory data analysis to explore the data and identify patterns.
6. Built interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and tables, incorporating slicers and filters for enhanced interactivity.
7. Utilized Power BI’s analytics features such as forecasting and trend lines to derive insights.
8. I have attached the .pbix file and snapshots of the dashboards.

Project 2 : HR Data Analysis:

Using Jupyter Notebook:

1.Defined Objectives: Set clear goals to understand factors contributing to employee attrition and overall job satisfaction.

2.Data Collection: Imported the HR dataset using pandas.

3.Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy by checking for missing values and correcting errors.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted initial data exploration using summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to understand distributions and identify patterns.

5.Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing ones to better suit the analysis.

6.Predictive Analysis: Used logistic regression to predict employee attrition, evaluating model performance with accuracy scores and classification reports.

# Afame-Technologies-Data-Analysis-Internship-projects
This is the Github repository to store three projects done during my summer internship of 2 months at Afame Technologies as a Data Analyst Intern. These projects are Sales Data Analysis , HR Data Analysis and Titanic Survival Prediction. Thank You!

Project 1: Sales Data Analysis:
I have thoroughly analyzed our sales data using Power BI by following a systematic approach:

1. Defined clear objectives to identify sales trends, understand customer behavior, and optimize pricing strategies.
2. Imported and integrated the data using the "Get Data" feature in Power BI, combining multiple sources through Power Query Editor.
3. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats, and created necessary calculated columns.
4. Defined relationships between tables and created measures and calculated fields using DAX in the data modeling phase.
5. Used Power BI’s visualization tools for exploratory data analysis to explore the data and identify patterns.
6. Built interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and tables, incorporating slicers and filters for enhanced interactivity.
7. Utilized Power BI’s analytics features such as forecasting and trend lines to derive insights and created key performance indicators (KPIs).
8. Continuously monitored and updated the reports based on feedback, regularly refreshing data and improving visualizations to ensure the information remains current and actionable.
